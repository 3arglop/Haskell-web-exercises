Part Two
Recreate Github's
teams page layout in
a
file named github.html.

At this point how the
page looks is not
as important as how
the page is structured.
What are the most
appropriate semantic
elements
to be used in a
layout like this one?.


Github teams

At the end of this
exercise, your page
might look closer to
this example:

Github teams

Hint: The element
titled 'Codeup dev
team'
is a table element!

For the example user
avatars you can use
this random user
avatar generator

For the logos you
can use placeholder.pics.
The following examples
will create 2
placeholder
images, 30 and 48
pixels each.


http://placeholder.
pics/svg/30  # Use
this
one for the 2 first
images
http://placeholder.
pics/svg/48  # Use
this
one for the images
in the table
Copy the URLs in your
browser and save the
images in your project's
img directory (30x30.svg
and 48x48.svg).
This will speed up
the loading time
of your page.

Finally, commit the
changes to your git
repository, and push
to GitHub.
