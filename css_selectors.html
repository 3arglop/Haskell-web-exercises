                <p class="paragraph">"Netflix has said that more than <em class="emphasis">100 million</em> households are
                    using accounts paid for by other people, and blamed password sharing as
                    one of the primary reasons for its flagging subscriber growth. The company
                    lost <em class="emphasis">200,000</em> customers in the first quarter, and forecast it would lose <em class="emphasis">2
                    million</em> more in the second. Its share price has dropped more than <em class="emphasis">65%</em> this
                    year as investors fret that the streaming business is in trouble."</p>

                <p class="paragraph">"A proposal to let parents over addictive social media features failed
                    in the California legislature this week. The bill, <em class="emphasis">AB 2408</em>, failed to pass out of committee
                    for a full state Senate vote. It at least temporarily ends a controversial push to increase
                    liability for social media in the state — an increasingly common practice among legislators.
                    <em class="emphasis">AB 2408</em>, or the <em class="emphasis">Social Media Platform Duty to Children Act</em>, was one of numerous state-level
                    social media proposals. It would have authorized civil penalties against social networks
                    whose designs caused a <em class="emphasis">'child user ... to become addicted to the platform,'</em> either by design
                    or in a way the operators should have known was harmful. It would not have applied to
                    social networks that generate <em class="emphasis">less than $100 million</em> annually or are primarily intended for
                    video games."
