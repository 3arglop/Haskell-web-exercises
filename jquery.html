    <ul class="funFacts">
        <li>jQuery was originally called "JSelect" (for selecting elements out of the page, plus it started with JS, which was nice). However the domain name jselect.com wasn’t available, thus jQuery it was.</li>

        <li>There were no optional curly braces used in initial release of jQuery.</li>

        <li>jQuery had proper method chaining from the very beginning. The chaining in jQuery has gone on to influence a large number of other libraries, even in other languages...</li>

        <li>The first jQuery plugin was created by Michael Geary on January 25th, just 11 days after the first release of the library (even before this particular version of the file!): JSON for jQuery</li>
